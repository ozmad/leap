"""Safely relocate a Claude Code session's on-disk state across cwds.

Claude Code stores each session under
``~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`` plus an *optional*
sidecar directory at ``~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<uuid>/`` that
holds sub-agent transcripts and overflow tool outputs.  Resuming a
session requires Claude to be invoked with ``cwd == src_cwd`` so it
can find the transcript by slug.

This module relocates the transcript (and sidecar, if present) so the
same session can be resumed under a different cwd::

  src = ~/.claude/projects/<slug(src_cwd)>/<uuid>.jsonl  [+ <uuid>/]
  dst = ~/.claude/projects/<slug(dst_cwd)>/<uuid>.jsonl  [+ <uuid>/]

The atomic-move primitives (signal blocking, copy/verify/rename) live
in :mod:`leap.utils.relocation`; this module is the Claude-specific
orchestrator.  ``RelocationError`` is re-exported here for callers
that historically imported it from this module.
