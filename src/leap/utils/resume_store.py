"""Shared read/write layer for ``leap --resume`` session records.

Every resumable CLI session recorded by the hook processor lands in
``<storage>/cli_sessions/<cli>/<tag>.json``.  This module is the
single source of truth for that file's schema and lifecycle so the
writer (``leap-hook-process.py``) and the reader (``leap-resume.py``)
can't drift apart.

On disk, each file holds a JSON list of entries shaped::

    {
        "session_id":      str,    # CLI-specific stable id (uuid, chat id, …)
        "transcript_path": str,    # may be '' for CLIs that don't write one
        "cwd":             str,    # the CLI's cwd at record time
        "last_seen":       float,  # Unix timestamp of the most recent hook fire
    }

Writers call :func:`record_session` to upsert an entry (dedup by
``session_id``, cap to :data:`MAX_ENTRIES_PER_TAG`, atomic rename);
readers call :func:`load_tag_rows` to get a pre-filtered list of
``TagRow`` values, newest-first, with stale (disk-deleted transcript)
entries already dropped.
