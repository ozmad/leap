#
# Leap Hook Script for CLI providers (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, Gemini CLI, etc.)
#
# Called by CLI hooks on Stop and Notification events.
# Writes state (and response text) to a signal file that the Leap server reads.
#
# The state is passed as the first argument by the hook configuration:
#   leap-hook.sh idle             (Stop hook)
#   leap-hook.sh needs_permission (Notification/permission_prompt)
#   leap-hook.sh needs_input      (Notification/elicitation_dialog)
#
# The CLI passes JSON on stdin with session info.  Claude Code includes
# transcript_path; Codex includes last_assistant_message directly.
# Cursor Agent includes status and workspace_roots.
# Gemini CLI includes prompt, prompt_response, and transcript_path.
#
# Environment variables (set by Leap server via PTY):
#   LEAP_TAG          - Session tag name
#   LEAP_SIGNAL_DIR   - Directory for signal files
#   LEAP_CLI_PROVIDER - CLI provider name (routes `leap --resume` recordings)
#   LEAP_PROJECT_DIR  - Leap project root (exported by the user's shell rc)
#
# Fallback: if env vars are missing (some CLIs don't pass the parent
# environment to hook subprocesses), the script recovers context by:
#   1. Regex-reading `export LEAP_PROJECT_DIR="…"` out of the user's
#      `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` / `~/.bash_profile` — the same line
#      `make install` already writes.
#   2. Walking up the PPID chain looking for
#      `<project>/.storage/pid_maps/<ppid>.json` which the Leap server
#      writes at CLI-spawn time.
#

# from a stale venv can leak in here even when the Leap server itself
# was launched with a clean env.  Without this unset a poisoned shell
# state would cause every hook fire to crash with "Failed to import
# encodings", which silently breaks state tracking and resume.

# written by the Leap server.  The ``<project>`` dir is found via either:
#   1. ``$LEAP_PROJECT_DIR`` env (set by user's shell rc) — fast path, OR
#   2. regex-reading the same ``export LEAP_PROJECT_DIR="…"`` line that
#      ``make install`` wrote into ``~/.zshrc`` / ``~/.bashrc``.
# That's the single anchor from which every other piece of context is
# discoverable — no ``/tmp``, no separate config file.
