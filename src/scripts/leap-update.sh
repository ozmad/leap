# Leap Update - Phase 1: Pre-pull checks + git pull
#
# After pulling, exec's into `make .update-after-pull` so that Phase 2
# (deps, shell config, hooks, IDE config) runs from the FRESHLY PULLED
# Makefile.  This means changes to the update flow itself take effect
# on the same `leap --update` run, not the next one.
#

# Strip env vars that can poison Python before it starts.  PYTHONHOME
# from a stale/abandoned venv triggers ``Failed to import encodings``
# in poetry/python sub-calls; VIRTUAL_ENV would make poetry use the
# wrong project's venv.  Only affects this script's children (including
# the make recipes it execs into), not the user's shell.
